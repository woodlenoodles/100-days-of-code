# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 3rd 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned print(), input() functions and variable naming.

**Thoughts:** Struggled when trying to get 2 variables to spit out each other's values. c = a, a = b, b = c. But there is a way to do that with only 2 variables!

### Day 2: February 4th 2022

**Today's Progress**: Data type manipulation. PEMDAS. Built BMI calculator and tip calculator. Formatting decimal points = "{:.2f}".format(variable)

**Thoughts** How do you write piped code?
